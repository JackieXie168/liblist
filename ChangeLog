	* liblist-2.3.1:
	- #defines to prevent symbol collions such as with libmysqlclient.so ( http://bugs.mysql.com/52725 )
	- API now uses typedefs instead of macros for types
	- a very basic testsuite
	- release 2.3 isn't distributed because it was a dud without the shared object ABI version bump or these changelogs
